        "Add holy basil leaves and toss quickly for 30 seconds until wilted. Remove from heat immediately. Meanwhile, fry eggs in separate pan until crispy-edged. Serve over rice with fried egg on top.",

        "Italian Basil: Last resort. Much milder flavor. Use double the amount and add at very end.",
        "Storage Tip: Keep basil stems in water like flowers. Don't refrigerate - it will turn black."
